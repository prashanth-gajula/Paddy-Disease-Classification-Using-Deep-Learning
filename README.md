# Paddy-Disease-Classification-Using-Deep-Learning
Paddy, an unhusked form of rice, is prone to several diseases sometimes, leading to a loss of 70% of yield. Manual supervision of paddy diseases is a costly and time-consuming process. So a reliable method that saves farmers time and money is highly demanded. With the advancement of deep learning and computer vision, we implemented a multiclass classification technique to classify the given paddy leaf into ten classes out of 9 disease classes and one regular class, the nine disease classes, are bacterial leaf blight, bacterial leaf streak, bacterial pinnacle blight, blast, brown spot, dead Heart, downy Mildew, hispa, and tungro. We developed four distinct deep learning models to address this issue, one of which, Vision Transformers, performed excellently and attained a validation accuracy of 91.30%.
